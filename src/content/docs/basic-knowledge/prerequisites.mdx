# Technical Prerequisites

To contribute effectively to this project, developers must be proficient in three foundational pillars. Below are the required skill sets and their official documentation for reference.

## 1. Type Safety with TypeScript

We use **TypeScript** to ensure that our data structures are consistent across the entire app. Payload CMS is built with a "code-first" approach, meaning our database schema is generated directly from TypeScript code.

- **Objective:** Understand Types, Interfaces, and Generics.
- **Resource:** [TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)

## 2. Version Control with Git

Git is our tool for collaboration. We use a structured commit system to keep the project's history clean and traceable.

- **Workflow:** Feature-branching and Pull Requests.
- **Resource:** [Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc)
- **Visuals:** [GitHub Skills](https://skills.github.com/)

## 3. Node.js & Package Managers

The project runs on the Node.js runtime. Familiarity with `npm` or `pnpm` is essential for managing dependencies and running local development scripts.

- **Core Commands:** `install`, `run dev`, `run build`.
- **Resource:** [Node.js Guides](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/)

## 4. Containerization with Docker

This project is fully containerized. Developers do not need to install PostgreSQL or other services locally on their machine; Docker handles the environment orchestration.

- **Objective:** Understand `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Resource:** [Docker Get Started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)

### Knowledge Check
Before proceeding to the architecture section, ensure you can:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` and `docker-compose up`.
3. Understand why a variable is typed as `string` or `number` in the codebase.
