# What is Payload CMS?

Payload is an enterprise-grade, **Headerless CMS** built on Node.js and TypeScript. Unlike other CMS platforms (like WordPress) which are built primarily for blogging, Payload is built for developers who need complete control over their data schema and admin interface.

## Core Philosophy: Code-First

In Payload, you don't create "tables" in a database UI. instead, you write **TypeScript Collections**. Payload automatically:
1.  Generates the database schema.
2.  Creates a REST and GraphQL API.
3.  Builds the Admin UI based on your code.

## How it Operates (Data Flow)

The SMK6 Engine follows a linear data flow:

1.  **Content Entry:** Admin users enter data in the Payload Admin Panel.
2.  **Storage:** Payload stores this data in the PostgreSQL database.
3.  **API Layer:** Payload exposes this data via a secure API endpoint.
4.  **Frontend Delivery:** Next.js fetches this data during build time (Static) or request time (Dynamic) and renders it for the students/parents.

## Why We Chose Payload for SMK6:

-   **Infinite Flexibility:** We can create any content type, from "Student Achievements" to "School Agenda".
-   **Security:** Native authentication and fine-grained Access Control (ACL).
-   **Developer Experience:** Everything is typed. If you change a field name, the compiler will tell you everywhere it's broken in the frontend.
