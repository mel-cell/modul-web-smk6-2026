The SMK Negeri 6 Malang web project is built on the philosophy of **"Content as Data"**. Unlike traditional CMS platforms that tightly couple the presentation layer with the data, this project utilizes a **Headless architecture**.

## Why Headless?

In a traditional setup, the CMS (Content Management System) decides how your content looks. In a Headless setup, the CMS (Payload) serves your content through an API, and the Frontend (Next.js) decides how to display it.

### Key Benefits:
- **Omnichannel:** The same content can be served to a website, a mobile app, or a digital kiosk in the school hall.
- **Future-Proof:** We can swap the frontend technology (e.g., move from Next.js to Astro) without ever losing or migrating our core content.
- **Security:** The admin panel is decoupled from the public-facing site, reducing the attack surface.

## The SMK6 Stack

Our ecosystem is composed of several industry-standard technologies:

1.  **Frontend:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (React Framework)
2.  **CMS:** [Payload CMS](https://payloadcms.com/) (Node.js Headless CMS)
3.  **Database:** PostgreSQL (Relational Database)
4.  **Runtime:** Node.js (TypeScript)
5.  **Infrastructure:** Docker & Docker Compose

## What This Module Covers

This documentation is split into logical parts to ensure a smooth onboarding process for new developers:
- **Part 1:** Technical Prerequisites & Basic Knowledge.
- **Part 2:** Deep dive into Payload's Architecture.
- **Part 3:** Engineering workflows and UI development.
