# Core Concepts

Payload CMS revolves around three main structural components. Mastering these is key to understanding how the SMK6 Engine functions.

## 1. Collections

**Collections** are used for data that has multiple entries. They are analogous to database tables.
- **Example in SMK6:** `News`, `Teachers`, `Students`, `Majors`.
- **Usage:** Use a collection whenever you need a list of similar items that can be searched, filtered, and paginated.

## 2. Globals

**Globals** are for data that only has one single entry.
- **Example in SMK6:** `HeaderConfiguration`, `FooterSettings`, `BrandIdentity`.
- **Usage:** Use a global when you only need one instance of a data set (e.g., the school's social media links or logo).

## 3. Fields

**Fields** are the smallest building blocks. They define what kind of data is stored within a Collection or Global.

### Common Field Types in our Project:
- **Text:** Simple string for titles or names.
- **Rich Text (Lexical):** For complex body content (articles, descriptions).
- **Upload:** For images, PDFs, and documents (linked to the `Media` collection).
- **Relationship:** Links one entry to another (e.g., linking a `Student` to a `Major`).
- **Blocks:** Our secret weapon for page building. Blocks allow us to create dynamic layouts by stacking pre-defined UI components.

## 4. Access Control

This project uses **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**.
- **Admins:** Can manage everything.
- **Editors:** Can only manage specific content like `News`.
- **Public:** Can only read published content via the API.

:::tip[Best Practice]
When adding a new field, always ask: "Is this data reusable?" If yes, consider using a **Relationship** or a **Global** instead of hardcoding text.
